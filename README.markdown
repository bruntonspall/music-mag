Title: The Music Mag

This is a simple app that should show you a music magazine.
The admin interface will support you selecting articles and pictures from last.fm and guardian.co.uk to build your magazine, and then launching the magazine should release a new issue

URLS:
 * /admin -> The admin interface
 * / -> redirect to /issue/[current]
 * /issue -> List of all issues
 * /issue/1 -> Issue 1

This should render beautifully on the iPad including swishy page slide/turn animation.

Bonuses if we manage it:
Nice admin interface with nice jquery plugins
iPad detection and bookmarking
Offline mode using HTML5 webcache n stuff
Google Chrome webapp mode
